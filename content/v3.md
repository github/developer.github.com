# API v3

This describes the Resources that make up the official GitHub API v3.
You can look at the [API v2](http://develop.github.com/) to access
resources that have not yet been added to v3.

Visit [GitHub API
Support](http://support.github.com/discussions/api) if you
have any problems or requests.

**Note:** This API is in a beta state.  Breaking changes may occur.

## Schema

All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from the `api.github.com`
domain.  All data is sent and received as JSON.

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -i https://api.github.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Status: 200 OK
X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4999
Content-Length: 2

{}
</pre>

Blank fields are included as `null` instead of being omitted.

All timestamps are returned in ISO 8601 format:

    YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ

## HTTP Verbs

Where possible, API v3 strives to use appropriate HTTP verbs for each
action.

HEAD
: Can be issued against any resource to get just the HTTP header info.

GET
: Used for retrieving resources.

POST
: Used for creating resources, or performing custom actions (such as
merging a pull request).

PATCH
: Used for updating resources with partial JSON data.  For instance, an
Issue resource has `title` and `body` attributes.  A PATCH request will
accept just one of the attributes to update the resource.  PATCH is a
relatively new and uncommon HTTP verb, so resource endpoints also accept
POST requests.

PUT
: Used for replacing resources or collections.

DELETE
: Used for deleting resources.

## Authentication

There are two ways to authenticate through GitHub API v3:

Basic Authentication:

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -u "username:PASSWORD" https://api.github.com
</pre>

OAuth2 Token (sent in a header):

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -H "Authorization: token OAUTH-TOKEN" https://api.github.com
</pre>

OAuth2 Token (sent as a parameter):

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl https://api.github.com?access_token=OAUTH-TOKEN
</pre>

Read [more about OAuth2](http://develop.github.com).

## Pagination

Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 30 items by
default.  You can specify further pages with the `?page` parameter.  You
can also set a custom page size up to 100 with the `?per_page` parameter.

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos.json?page=2&per_page=100
</pre>

## Rate Limiting

We limit requests to API v3 to 5000 per day.  This is keyed off either your
login, or your request IP.  You can check the returned HTTP headers to see your
current status:

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -i https://api.github.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Status: 200 OK
X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4966
</pre>

You can file a [support issue](http://support.github.com/dashboard/queues/2386-api)
to request white listed access for your application.  We prefer sites that
setup OAuth applications for their users.

## JSON-P Callbacks

You can send a `?callback` parameter to any GET call to have the results
wrapped in a JSON function.  This is typically used when browsers want
to embed GitHub content in web pages by getting around cross domain
issues.  The responses always return 200, and are wrapped in meta
objects containing the actual meta information:

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl https://api.github.com?callback=foo

foo({
  "data": {},
  "meta": {
    "status": 200,
    "pagination": {"page": 1, "per_page": 30},
    "rate": {"key": "IP ADDRESS", "remaining": 4999, "limit": 5000}
  }
})
</pre>

## Versions

Api V3 uses content negotiation to specify the expected output format.
V3 is specified with this mime type:

    application/vnd.github.v3+json

This allows us to upgrade the API if needed, and support multiple versions of
the API in a transition period.  If you want to ensure your API usage works
uninterrupted, you will want to specify this mime type in an Accept header:

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" https://api.github.com
</pre>

Specifying `application/json` will assume the latest version of the API.
Specifying an unknown version will result in a `406 Not Acceptable` error.

We don't plan to bump the API version unless absolutely necessary.  Things
like removing end points, renaming or removing object attributes, or removing
resources completely will result in a new version.  This should be extremely
rare, however.

If you depend on the stability of the GitHub API, you should watch
[GitHub API
Support](http://support.github.com/discussions/api).  We'll be
posting updates to the API there.  Any major changes will be sent to
users that have an active GitHub OAuth Application setup.
