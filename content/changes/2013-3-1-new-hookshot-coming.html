We are experimenting with changes to the "Hookshot" backend that powers service
hooks.  There were some significant networking changes with the new cluster,
so there are some new IP whitelist rules for hooks:

* 204.232.175.64/27
* 192.30.252.0/22

These are in CIDR notation.  They represent a significant range of GitHub
addresses, meaning this should be the last IP change for a while.  Once this
cluster is activated and we shut the other cluster down, we will be removing
the other entries.

We are currently testing the new backend with all repositories in the GitHub
organization only, and expect to start testing it with user data next week.

This also means we should be able to start accepting [GitHub Services pull
requests](https://github.com/github/github-services/pulls) very soon :)
