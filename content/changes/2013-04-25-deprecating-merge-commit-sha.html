title: Deprecating a Confusing Attribute in the Pull Request API

When you get the details for a Pull Request from the API, the
[response](/v3/pulls/#get-a-single-pull-request) provides everything there is to
know about that Pull Request. In addition to the useful information provided in
the API response, the JSON also includes the `merge_commit_sha` attribute. This
attribute is a frequent source of misunderstanding, and we aim to remove the
confusion.

To help current API consumers, we've [documented the
attribute](/v3/pulls/#mergability) for improved understanding.

To protect future API consumers from this confusion, we have
[deprecated](/#expected-changes) the `merge_commit_sha` attribute, and we will
remove it in the next major version of the API.

As always, if you have any questions or feedback, please drop us a line at
[support@github.com](mailto:support@github.com?subject=Deprecating merge_commit_sha).
