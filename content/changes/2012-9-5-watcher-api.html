We recently [changed the Watcher behavior][change-watching] on GitHub.  What
used to be known as "Watching", is now "Starring".  Starring is basically
a way to bookmark interesting repositories.  Watching is a way to indicate that
you want to receive email or web notifications on a Repository.

This works well on GitHub.com, but poses a problem for the GitHub API.  How do
we change this in a way that developers can gracefully upgrade their
applications?  We're currently looking at rolling out the changes in three
phases over an extended period of time.

## Current Status

The current [Repository Starring][starring-api] methods look like this:

* `/repos/:owner/:repo/watchers` - A list of users starring the repository.
* `/users/:user/watched` - A list of repositories that a user has starred.
* `/user/watched` - A list of repositories the current user has starred.

## Phase 1: Add Watchers as Subscriptions

In addition to this, we'll expose Watchers as "Subscriptions".  This is to
keep from clashing with the legacy endpoint.

* `/repos/:owner/:repo/subscribers` - A list of users watching the repository.
* `/users/:user/subscribed` - A list of repositories that a user is watching.
* `/user/subscriptions` - A list of repositories the current user is watching.

We'll also add a copy of the legacy Watchers API in the new endpoint:

* `/repos/:owner/:repo/stargazers` - A list of users starring the repository.
* `/users/:user/starred` - A list of repositories that a user has starred.
* `/user/starred` - A list of repositories the current user has starred.

This will be done with the current mime type for the API:

    application/vnd.github.beta+json

If you care about your application not breaking, make sure all outgoing API
requests pass that value for the "Accept" header.

    # Accesses a user's starred repositories.
    curl https://api.github.com/user/watched \
      -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.beta+json"

## Phase 2: Switch `/watchers` API Endpoint

The "watch" endpoints will now be a copy of the "subscription" endpoints.  You
will have to use `/user/starred` to get a user's starred repositories, not
`/user/watched`.

This requires a new mime type value:

    application/vnd.github.v3+json

We will release this change in an experimental mode first, letting developers
gracefully upgrade their applications by specifying the new mime value for the
Accept header.

    # Accesses a user's watched repositories.
    curl https://api.github.com/user/watched \
      -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json"

## Phase 3: Remove `/subscribers` API Endpoint.

This phase involves disabling the subscription endpoints completely.  At this
point, you should be using the starring endpoints for starred repositories, and
the watch endpoints for watched repositories.

At this point, keep on passing the "v3" mimetype in your application, until the
API has another breaking change to make.
