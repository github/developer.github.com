    <p>We’re delaying the breaking change to the <a href="/v3/orgs/teams/#add-team-member">“Add team member” API</a> by another week to give developers more time to update their applications.</p>

<p>The <a href="/changes/2014-09-16-finalizing-the-organization-and-team-membership-apis/">breaking change to the “Add team member” API</a> will go into effect for all requests on <strong>September 30, 2014</strong>. At that time, if you use <a href="/v3/orgs/teams/#add-team-member">the “Add team member” API</a> to add a user to a team and that user isn’t already on another team in your organization, the request will fail. To avoid this, be sure to use the <a href="/v3/orgs/teams/#add-team-membership">the “Add team membership” API</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-organization-and-team-membership-apis-are-now-official">The Organization and Team Membership APIs are now official</h3>

<p>As promised in <a href="/changes/2014-09-16-finalizing-the-organization-and-team-membership-apis/">our blog post last week</a>, the <a href="/changes/2014-08-28-accepting-organization-invitations-from-the-api/">Organization Membership</a> and <a href="/changes/2014-08-05-team-memberships-api/">Team Membership</a> APIs are now an official part of the GitHub API! The preview media type is no longer required to access them.</p>

    <p>For the past few weeks, the new <a href="/changes/2014-08-28-accepting-organization-invitations-from-the-api/">Organization Membership</a> and <a href="/changes/2014-08-05-team-memberships-api/">Team Membership</a> APIs have been available for early access via a preview media type.  As of today, these APIs are stable and suitable for production use.</p>

<h3 id="preview-period-ends-on-september-23">Preview period ends on September 23</h3>

<p>On September 23, 2014, these APIs will become official parts of the GitHub API v3. At that time, the preview media type will no longer be required to access these APIs.</p>

<h3 id="reminder-breaking-change-to-legacy-endpoint">Reminder: Breaking change to legacy endpoint</h3>

<p>The <a href="/v3/orgs/teams/#add-team-member">breaking change to the “Add team member” endpoint</a> will also go into effect for all requests on <strong>September 23, 2014</strong>. At that time, if you use the <a href="/v3/orgs/teams/#add-team-member">add team member</a> endpoint to add a user to a team and that user isn’t already on another team in your organization, the request will fail.

<h3 id="addition-to-the-organization-membership-api">Addition to the Organization Membership API</h3>

<p>Thanks to your feedback, we’ve updated the Organization Membership API to provide direct access to basic information about the organization whenever you fetch a <a href="/v3/orgs/members/#list-your-organization-memberships">list of memberships</a> or a <a href="/v3/orgs/members/#get-your-organization-membership">single membership</a>.</p>

    <p>We have deprecated the <code>current_user_organization_url</code> attribute and the
<code>current_user_organization.href</code> attribute in the <a href="/v3/activity/feeds/">Feeds API</a>. If you make
use of these attributes, you’ll want to update your code to use the new
<code>current_user_organization_urls</code> attribute instead.</p>

<h3 id="changes-to-the-deprecated-attributes">Changes to the deprecated attributes</h3>

<p>Previously, the deprecated attributes returned URI template. For example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript highlight highlight"><span class="s2">"current_user_organization_url"</span><span class="err">:</span>
  <span class="s2">"https://github.com/organizations/{org}/mastahyeti.private.atom?token=abc123"</span></code></pre>

<p>The template included a deprecated authentication token. Our new tokens are
valid only for a concrete feed URL (not for a URI template). Because the
deprecated attributes were templates and did not specify a concrete URL, the API
could not provide a token that could be used for organization feeds.</p>

<p>Starting today, the API returns empty values for the deprecated attributes.</p>

<h3 id="new-attribute-for-organization-feeds">New attribute for organization feeds</h3>

<p>In order to preserve the functionality of this API, we have added a new
attribute that lists specific Atom feed urls for each of the user’s
organizations.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript highlight highlight"><span class="s2">"current_user_organization_urls"</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
  <span class="s2">"https://github.com/organizations/github/mastahyeti.private.atom?token=abc123"</span>
  <span class="s2">"https://github.com/organizations/requests/mastahyeti.private.atom?token=token=def456"</span>
<span class="p">]</span></code></pre>

<p>Check out the updated <a href="/v3/activity/feeds/">Feeds API documentation</a> for the new fields. If you

    <p>We have deprecated the <code>gravatar_id</code> attribute in the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/users/">user
representation</a>. Starting September 19,
the API will always provide an empty string as the value for this attribute.</p>

<p>Users have been able to upload avatars directly to GitHub for <a href="https://github.com/blog/1803-switch-your-picture-with-ease">a while
now</a>. If users
haven’t uploaded an avatar, we still try to fetch one from Gravatar, but that
happens behind the scenes on GitHub’s servers. As a result, the <code>gravatar_id</code>
attribute no longer identifies a GitHub user’s canonical avatar. Instead, API
consumers should use the <code>avatar_url</code> to fetch a user’s avatar. The <code>avatar_url</code>
attribute has always been present in the <a href="/v3/users/">v3 user representation</a>
and is the only reliable way to find a GitHub user’s avatar.</p>

    <p>The upcoming <a href="/changes/2014-08-05-team-memberships-api/">Team Memberships API</a> gives you the power to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-or-inviting-members-to-a-team-in-an-organization">invite</a> new GitHub users to your organization via the API. We’re expanding the API to also allow users to view their organization membership statuses and accept any invitations they’ve received.</p>

<h3 id="the-new-organization-memberships-api">The new Organization Memberships API</h3>

<p>When someone <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-or-inviting-members-to-a-team-in-an-organization">invites</a> you to an organization, your membership with that organization begins in the “pending” state. The new <a href="/v3/orgs/members/#list-your-organization-memberships">list organization memberships</a> endpoint allows you to find your pending memberships. You can then change them to “active” (accepting the invitation in the process) by using the <a href="/v3/orgs/members/#edit-your-organization-membership">edit organization membership</a> endpoint.</p>

<h3 id="new-team-membership-api-response-attribute">New Team Membership API response attribute</h3>

<p>Previously, responses from the <a href="/v3/orgs/teams/#add-team-membership">add team membership</a> and <a href="/v3/orgs/teams/#get-team-membership">get team membership</a> endpoints included a “status” attribute, which could either be “active” or “pending”. We’ve renamed this attribute from “status” to “state” for better consistency with our other API calls.</p>

<p>To give you time to update your apps, we’ll keep the legacy “status” attribute around alongside the new “state” attribute until <strong>September 4th, 2014</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="preview-period">Preview period</h3>

<p>The new Organization Memberships API is available for developers to preview alongside the <a href="/changes/2014-08-05-team-memberships-api/">Team Memberships API</a>. During this period, we may change aspects of these endpoints. If we do, we will announce the changes on the developer blog, but we will not provide any advance notice.</p>

<p>While these new APIs are in their preview period, you’ll need to provide the following custom media type in the <code>Accept</code> header:</p>

<pre><code>application/vnd.github.the-wasp-preview+json
</code></pre>

<p>We expect the preview period to last 30-60 days. At the end of the preview period, the Team and Organization Memberships APIs will become official components of GitHub API v3.</p>

</div>

    <p>We’ve added two new features to the <a href="https://developer.github.com/changes/2014-01-09-preview-the-new-deployments-api/">Deployments API preview</a>: the ability to query deployments and a new <code>task</code> attribute for different types of deployment tasks.</p>

<h2 id="api-changes">API changes</h2>

<p>You can now search for deployments via query parameters to the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/deployments/#list-deployments">listing endpoint</a>. You can filter on <code>sha</code>, <code>ref</code>, <code>task</code>, and <code>environment</code>. This makes it easier to answer questions like “when was the last time someone deployed to staging?”</p>

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -H "Authorization: token [yours]" \
       https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/my-repo/deployments?environment=staging
</pre>

<h2 id="new-attribute">New attribute</h2>

<p>We’ve also added a <code>task</code> attribute to the deployment resource. The <code>task</code> attribute allows you to specify tasks other than just pushing code. Popular deployment tools like <a href="http://capistranorb.com/">capistrano</a> and <a href="http://www.fabfile.org/">fabric</a> support named tasks to do things like running schema migrations. We hope this attribute will give integrators the flexibility they need to provide custom functionality.</p>

</div>

    <p>Today, we’re announcing a change to the way organization owners add new members to their organization.</p>

<p>Previously, if you were an organization owner, you could use the <a href="/v3/orgs/teams/#add-team-member">add team member</a> endpoint to add any GitHub user to any team on your organization without any sort of approval from them. Now, we’re increasing user security by sending <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-or-inviting-members-to-a-team-in-an-organization">invitations</a> to users when they’re added to teams on organizations that they aren’t yet a part of.</p>

<p>With this change, if you use the <a href="/v3/orgs/teams/#add-team-member">add team member</a> endpoint to add a user to a team and that user isn’t already on another team in your organization, the request will fail.</p>

<h3 id="the-new-team-memberships-api">The new Team Memberships API</h3>

<p>You should change all your <a href="/v3/orgs/teams/#add-team-member">add team member</a> requests to use the new <a href="/v3/orgs/teams/#add-team-membership">add team membership</a> endpoint. This new endpoint works exactly the same as the old one, with one important change: if the membership being added is for a user who is unaffiliated with the team’s organization, that user will be sent an invitation via email.</p>

<p>Unlike the <a href="/v3/orgs/teams/#add-team-member">add team member</a> endpoint, a successful request to the <a href="/v3/orgs/teams/#add-team-membership">add team membership</a> endpoint does <em>not</em> guarantee that the user is now a member of the team. If you’re trying to migrate to the new endpoint and need to know when a user has been successfully added (not just invited) to a team, please check out <a href="/v3/activity/events/types/#teamaddevent">TeamAddEvent</a>.</p>

<h3 id="preview-period">Preview period</h3>

<p>We’re making the new Team Memberships API (and the breaking changes to the <a href="/v3/orgs/teams/#add-team-member">add team member</a> API) available today for developers to preview. During this period, we may change aspects of these endpoints. If we do, we will announce the changes on the developer blog, but we will not provide any advance notice.</p>

<p>While these new APIs are in their preview period, you’ll need to provide the following custom media type in the <code>Accept</code> header:</p>

<pre><code>application/vnd.github.the-wasp-preview+json

<p>We expect the preview period to last 30-60 days. At the end of the preview period, the Team Memberships API will become an official component of GitHub API v3, as will the <a href="/v3/orgs/teams/#add-team-member">add team member</a> API’s breaking changes.</p>

The payload will also include the respective assignee or label for these new actions.</p>

<p>If you already have a <a href="/webhooks/">webhook</a> subscribed to the <code>issues</code> or <code>pull_request</code> events, you’ll start seeing these new actions immediately. The new events can also be fetched from the <a href="/v3/issues/events/">issue events API</a>.</p>

    <p>We’re happy to announce that the <a href="/v3/repos/statuses/#get-the-combined-status-for-a-specific-ref">Combined Status API</a> is officially part

<p>Thanks to everyone who provided feedback during the comment period. We got
some great feedback, and hope this feature helps you build the tools you
need to make GitHub the best place to ship exactly the way you want.</p>

<h3 id="preview-media-type-no-longer-needed">Preview media type no longer needed</h3>

<p>If you used the Combined Status API during the preview period, you needed to
provide a custom media type in the <code>Accept</code> header:</p>

<pre><code>application/vnd.github.she-hulk-preview+json
</code></pre>

<p>Now that the preview period has ended, you no longer need to pass this custom
media type.</p>

<p>Instead, we <a href="/v3/media">recommend</a> that you specify <code>v3</code> as the version in the
<code>Accept</code> header:</p>

<pre><code>application/vnd.github.v3+json
</code></pre>

    <p>We’re getting close to bringing the <a href="/v3/repos/statuses/#get-the-combined-status-for-a-specific-ref">Combined Status API</a> out of preview
mode, and have just a couple of small changes to make before it’s :sparkles:.</p>

<p>First, we’re now <a href="/v3/#pagination">paginating</a> combined status API calls. The combined status
<code>state</code> field will always take all statuses into account, but we’ll now only
return 100 embedded statuses at a time.</p>

<p>Second, we’re adding a <code>total_count</code> field, mirroring the Search API. This
count represents the number of contexts submitted for the given commit.</p>

<p>As always, we’re interested in <a href="https://github.com/contact?form%5Bsubject%5D=Combined+Status+API">hearing your feedback</a>.</p>

    <p>Today we’re making a few minor changes to the <a href="https://developer.github.com/changes/2014-01-09-preview-the-new-deployments-api/">Deployments API preview</a>. With the introduction of <a href="https://developer.github.com/changes/2014-03-27-combined-status-api/">combined statuses</a> in a <a href="https://developer.github.com/changes/2014-04-10-deployment-api-preview-extension/">recent update</a>, we noticed a few inconsistencies with the API that we’d like to remedy.</p>

<p>We’re introducing a new parameter called <code>required_contexts</code>. This parameter accepts an array of named <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/">commit status</a> contexts that are ensured to be in a “success” state before the deployment is created. This allows you to verify that more than one system verified your code before you deploy it.</p>

<p>We’ve removed support for the <code>force</code> parameter. The force parameter existed to bypass both the auto-merge and commit status checks. The same behavior can now be accomplished by setting <code>auto_merge</code> and <code>required_contexts</code> appropriately.</p>

<p>We’re also setting a context for all <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/">commit statuses</a>. If a commit status is created without a context, we’ll now set it to the string “default”.</p>

    <p>We’re continuing to iterate on the <a href="https://developer.github.com/changes/2014-01-09-preview-the-new-deployments-api/">Deployments API preview</a>, and we’re starting to see it satisfy more and more use cases. Today we’re introducing new attributes for Deployments and Deployment Statuses as well as a few payload changes.</p>

<p><strong>This is a breaking change for Deployment Status payloads</strong>. If you’re trying out this new API during its preview period, you’ll need to update your code to continue working with it.</p>

<h2 id="api-changes">API Changes</h2>

<p>For Deployments we’re introducing the concept of an <code>environment</code>. An environment is basically a unique identifier for a deployment target. Lots of people tend toward the concept of environments for staging, QA, user acceptance testing, etc. We hope this enhancement will enable more use cases for our users that deploy to multiple environments.</p>

<p>Deployments are also persisting the requested deployment <code>ref</code>. Previously we resolved a ref to the current SHA for that ref. Now we’ll be keeping the ref around for historical purposes. This is especially helpful if you’re deploying branches to verify them before you merge them into your default branch (e.g., “master”).</p>

<h2 id="json-payload-changes">JSON Payload Changes</h2>

<p>We’re also adding a few attributes to the outbound Deployment payloads. We’re now including the <code>ref</code> attribute so you know the branch or tag name that resolved to a specific SHA. The <code>environment</code> is also present.</p>

<h2 id="webhook-changes">Webhook Changes</h2>

<p>The Deployment Status payloads now embed the associated Deployment object. With this enhancement, Deployment Status events received via webhooks will have enough information to notify other systems, without having to call back to the GitHub API for the <code>environment</code>, <code>ref</code>, or payload that was deployed.</p>

    <p>The <a href="/v3/repos/commits/">Repository Commits API</a> now supports an additional approach for paginating <a href="/v3/repos/commits/#list-commits-on-a-repository">commit lists</a>. As of today, this endpoint supports the “standard” <a href="/v3/#pagination"><code>page</code> and <code>per_page</code> parameters</a> for controlling pagination. This API now uses these parameters by default when constructing <a href="/v3/#pagination">page links</a>.</p>

<h2 id="improved-results-and-increased-consistency">Improved results and increased consistency</h2>

<p>This new approach improves the reliability of this endpoint, which on rare occasions skipped some commits during pagination. This enhancement also increases the overall consistency of the API, as all endpoints now paginate resource lists the same way.</p>

<h2 id="old-parameters-still-supported">Old parameters still supported</h2>

<p>The old way of paginating, using <code>top</code>, <code>last_sha</code>, and <code>per_page</code> parameters, is still supported in API v3, but it will be removed in the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/versions/#v3-deprecations">next major version of the API</a>. API clients that are manually constructing URLs for pages should be modified to use the new parameters. Even better, API clients shouldn’t construct URLs for pages manually, but should use <a href="/guides/traversing-with-pagination/">page links provided by the <code>Link</code> header</a> in API responses.</p>

<p>Since both the new and the old pagination parameters are still supported in API v3, API clients shouldn’t notice any changes today. Still, if you notice any problems with this endpoint, please <a href="https://github.com/contact?form%5Bsubject%5D=API:+Commits+pagination+improvements">let us know</a>.</p>

    <p>In order to provide a faster, more robust API for Gist, we are making two changes to better handle large files in <a href="/v3/gists/#detailed-gist-representation">Gist API responses</a>.</p>

<h3 id="truncating-file-contents-larger-than-one-megabyte">Truncating file contents larger than one megabyte</h3>

<p>The <a href="/v3/gists/#detailed-gist-representation">Gist API response</a> includes data for every file in the Gist. That works well for Gists with reasonably-sized files. When a Gist contains large files, however, it can lead to timeouts when preparing or sending the API response.</p>

<p>To eliminate those timeouts, the API now limits the amount of content returned for each file. If a file is larger than one megabyte in size, the API response will include the first megabyte of content for that file. (Few Gists have files this large. As a result, most API clients won’t notice any impact from this change.)</p>

<h3 id="new-truncated-attribute">New “truncated” attribute</h3>

<p>The JSON snippet below illustrates the attributes provided for each file in the Gist API response. In it, you’ll notice a new <code>truncated</code> attribute included as part of the file metadata. This Boolean attribute indicates whether the <code>content</code> value is truncated for this request.</p>

<pre><code>{
  files: {
    "my_large_file.md": {
      "size": 2097152,
      "content": "Large content. Truncated at end of first megabyte. [...]",
      "truncated": true,
      "raw_url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[...]/my_large_file.md",
      "type": "text/plain",
      "language": "Markdown"
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="getting-the-full-content-for-truncated-files">Getting the full content for truncated files</h3>

<p>We recognize that sometimes you’ll still want the full content for a file, even if it’s too large to get returned in the standard Gist API response. For files under 10 megabytes, simply make a request to the URL specified in the <code>raw_url</code> attribute, and you’ll receive the complete content for that file. For larger files, you’ll need to clone the gist locally via the <code>git_pull_url</code> to access the full file contents.</p>

    <h2 id="securing-your-content">Securing your content</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://bounty.github.com">GitHub Bug Bounty program</a> recently identified a few cross-domain vulnerabilities related to user-generated content, and we’ve shipped improvements today to address those issues.</p>

<p>In order to better isolate your content from potentially malicious content uploaded by other users (e.g., content that might contain Cross-Site Scripting or other embedded attacks), we now serve user-generated content from subdomains of <strong>githubusercontent.com</strong>. This content is no longer served from subdomains of <strong>github.com</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="whats-affected">What’s affected?</h2>

<p>This change affects the following subdomains:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>raw.github.com</strong> : Serves raw file content from your repository.</li>
  <li>
<strong>embed.github.com</strong> : Allows users to embed rich GitHub content on other sites.</li>
  <li>
<strong>render.github.com</strong> : Displays rich content on GitHub.com.</li>
  <li>
<strong>f.cloud.github.com</strong> : Hosts all those amazing gifs you use in Pull Requests and Issues.</li>
</ul>

<p>Content formerly served by these subdomains is now served from subdomains of <strong>githubusercontent.com</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="older-links">Older links</h2>

<p>If you have old links to this content, don’t worry: as of today, we’re forcing the old domains to redirect to the new domains. Your existing links should continue to work automatically in your browser. If you’re using a URL from Gist or GitHub to directly access user-generated content via <code>curl</code>, <code>wget</code>, or a library (like <a href="https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty">HTTParty</a>), be sure to configure that tool to follow the redirect.</p>

<h2 id="your-proxies-or-filters">Your proxies or filters</h2>

<p>Some security systems (web proxies, for example) may not recognize the <strong>githubusercontent.com</strong> domain. In those cases, you may need update your proxies and security software accordingly.</p>

    <p>Now that the GitHub API is <a href="/changes/2014-01-07-upcoming-change-to-default-media-type/">serving the v3 media type by default</a>, we are deprecating the legacy <a href="/v3/versions/#beta">beta media type</a>.</p>

<p>We will eventually remove support for the beta media type, but we have no official retirement date to annouce at the moment. When the time comes, rest assured that we’ll announce the retirement with plenty of notice. In the meantime, existing API clients that rely on the beta media type should start making plans to migrate to v3. The beta media type differs from v3 in <a href="/v3/versions/#differences-from-beta-version">just a few places</a>. In most cases, migrating an application from the beta media type to the v3 media type is smooth and painless.</p>

    <p>The preview period for the new <a href="/changes/2014-01-09-preview-the-new-deployments-api/">Deployments API</a> continues to yield valuable feedback from developers. In early March, we used that feedback to <a href="/changes/2014-03-03-deployments-api-updates/">improve the payload format</a> that integrations can use to customize deployments. A few weeks later, we began integrating with the new <a href="/changes/2014-03-27-combined-status-api/">Combined Status API</a> to help ensure that only verified code gets deployed, even if you have multiple systems verifying different aspects of your software.</p>

<p>To give developers time to explore these recent refinements to the Deployments API, we’re extending the preview period for a little while longer. As always, if you have any questions or feedback, please <a href="https://github.com/contact?form%5Bsubject%5D=Deployments+API">get in touch</a>.</p>

    <p>As <a href="https://github.com/blog/1818-security-heartbleed-vulnerability">announced earlier today</a>, we are actively responding
to the recently-disclosed <a href="https://github.com/blog/1818-security-heartbleed-vulnerability">Heartbleed security
vulnerability</a> in OpenSSL. While at this time GitHub has
no indication that the attack has been used beyond testing the vulnerability, we
recommend that integrators <a href="/v3/oauth_authorizations/#reset-an-authorization">reset the API authorizations</a> for their OAuth
applications.</p>

<p>We’ve added a <a href="/v3/oauth_authorizations/#reset-an-authorization">new API method</a> for this exact purpose. Calling this method
will invalidate the old token and return a new token for applications to store
and use in its place. This new method provides a safe way to reset user
authorizations without requiring users to re-authorize the application on the
web.</p>

<p>Integrators can also use the existing revocation methods to <a href="/v3/oauth_authorizations/#revoke-all-authorizations-for-an-application">revoke all
tokens</a> or <a href="/v3/oauth_authorizations/#revoke-an-authorization-for-an-application">revoke a single token</a> for their applications.</p>

    <p>Some queries are computationally expensive for our search infrastructure to
execute. To keep the <a href="/v3/search">Search API</a> fast for everyone, we limit how
long any individual query can run. In rare situations when a query exceeds the
time limit, the API returns all matches that were found prior to the timeout.</p>

<p>Starting today, the Search API also now <a href="/v3/search/#timeouts-and-incomplete-results">informs you when such a timeout
happens</a>. Reaching a timeout does
not necessarily mean that search results are incomplete. It just means that the
query was discontinued before it searched through all possible data. More
results might have been found, but also might not.</p>

<p>In some cases, if you know that your search results are potentially incomplete,
you might think about the data differently. By exposing timeouts when they
happen, the API helps you better understand how to interpret the results.</p>

<p>We hope this is useful as you integrate with the Search API. In the meantime,
we’re working on improving search so that these timeouts occur as rarely as
possible. If you have any questions, <a href="https://github.com/contact?form%5Bsubject%5D=Search+API">let us know</a>.</p>

    <p>What does it mean for a branch to be “green?” The <a href="/v3/repos/statuses/">Status API</a> helps
thousands of teams answer that question. Developers use it to record the status
of continuous integration builds, contributor license agreements, code coverage
analysis, automated security testing, dependency management, and more.</p>

<p>For many teams, a branch is considered “green” only when <em>all</em> of their various
status checks are successful. With the new <a href="/v3/repos/statuses/#get-the-combined-status-for-a-specific-ref">Combined Status
API</a>, developers can easily fetch this single, consolidated
status for any branch, commit, or tag.</p>

<h3 id="status-context">Status context</h3>

<p>To help multiple service providers use the Status API simultaneously, statuses
now support a <code>context</code> field. This field allows a provider to distinguish its
statuses from another provider’s statuses. For example, your <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> builds
might use a context of <code>ci/jenkins</code>, while your <a href="http://brakemanscanner.org/">Brakeman</a> checks might adopt a
context of <code>security/brakeman</code>.</p>

<p>The new <a href="/v3/repos/statuses/#get-the-combined-status-for-a-specific-ref">Combined Status endpoint</a> returns a single,
combined state, as well as the latest status from each context. Systems that
consume status updates can now get all the information they need in one place.</p>

<h3 id="opt-in">Opt-in</h3>

<p>The existing <a href="/v3/repos/statuses/#list-statuses-for-a-specific-ref">Status API</a> continues to work as it always has. The
<code>context</code> field is entirely optional, and the <a href="https://github.com/blog/1227-commit-status-api">color of the merge button on pull
requests</a> does not currently
take context into account.</p>

<h3 id="preview-period">Preview period</h3>

<p>We’re making this new API available today for developers to
<a href="/v3/repos/statuses/">preview</a>. During this period, we may change aspects of the Combined
Status API from time to time. We will announce any changes here (on the
developer blog), but we will not provide any advance notice.</p>

<p>We expect the preview period to last 30-60 days. At the end of preview period,
the Combined Status API will become an official component of GitHub API v3. At
that point, this new API will be stable and suitable for production use.</p>

<p>We hope you’ll <a href="/v3/repos/statuses/">try it out</a> and <a href="https://github.com/contact?form%5Bsubject%5D=Combined+Status+API">send us your feedback</a>!</p>

</div>

    <p>We have improved support for handling timezones in our API. For example, if you
create commits through the API, we now allow for specifying timezone information
more accurately.</p>

<p>We apply the following rules, in order of priority, to determine timezone
information for API calls:</p>

<h4 id="explicitly-provide-an-iso-8601-timestamp-with-timezone-information">Explicitly provide an ISO 8601 timestamp with timezone information</h4>

<p>For API calls that allow for a timestamp to be specified, we use that exact
timestamp. An example of this is the <a href="/v3/git/commits">Commits API</a> which allows
for specifying the <code>date</code> property.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript highlight highlight"><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="s2">"message"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"my commit message"</span><span class="p">,</span>

    <span class="s2">"name"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"Dirkjan Bussink"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">"email"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"d.bussink@gmail.com"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">"date"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"2014-02-27T15:05:06+01:00"</span>
  <span class="p">},</span>

<span class="p">}</span></code></pre>

<h4 id="using-the-time-zone-header">Using the <code>Time-Zone</code> header</h4>

<p>It is possible to supply a <code>Time-Zone</code> header which defines a timezone according
to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones">list of names from the Olson database</a>.</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -H "Time-Zone: Europe/Amsterdam" -X POST https://api.github.com/repos/github/linguist/contents/new_file.md
</code></pre>

<p>This means that we generate a timestamp for the moment your API call is made in
the timezone this header defines. For example, the <a href="/v3/repos/contents/">Contents API</a>
generates a git commit for each addition or change and uses the current time
as the timestamp. This header will determine the timezone used for generating
that current timestamp.</p>

<h4 id="using-the-last-known-timezone-for-the-user">Using the last known timezone for the user</h4>

<p>If no <code>Time-Zone</code> header is specified and you make an authenticated call to the
API, we use the last known timezone for the authenticated user. The last know
timezone is updated whenever you browse the GitHub.com website.</p>

<h4 id="utc">UTC</h4>

<p>If the steps above don’t result in any information, we use UTC as the timezone
to create the git commit.</p>

<p>You should only need to remove the JSON parsing if you’re taking advantage of the custom payloads. The formats for creating Deployments remain unchanged.</p>

    <p>We’ve made it even easier to list all <a href="/v3/issues/#list-issues">issues</a> and <a href="/v3/pulls/#list-pull-requests">pull requests</a> via the API.
The <code>state</code> parameter now supports a value of <code>all</code> that will return issues and
pull requests regardless of state.</p>

<pre class="terminal">

    <p>We’ve made a small change to make it easier for webhook integrators to receive “everything”.
Instead of adding every event to your webhook, you can now opt-in to all events (including

<p>If you add this event to an existing webhook, we’ll remove the existing specific events and

    <p>As <a href="https://github.com/blog/1786-enhanced-oauth-security-for-ssh-keys">we announced</a>, we’ve made some important changes to the way that API consumers manage SSH keys.</p>

<h2 id="finer-grained-oauth-scopes">Finer-grained OAuth scopes</h2>

<p>To help third party applications request only permissions that they need, the API now supports three new <a href="/v3/oauth/#scopes">scopes</a> for working with a user’s public SSH keys.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<code>read:public_key</code> provides read access to the user’s SSH keys</li>
  <li>
<code>write:public_key</code> allows an app to read existing keys and create new ones</li>
  <li>
<code>admin:public_key</code> enables an app to read, write, and delete keys</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="changes-to-user-scope">Changes to <code>user</code> scope</h2>

<p>Historically, <code>user</code> scope has provided full access to manage a user’s SSH keys. Now that we have dedicated scopes for managing a user’s SSH keys, we have removed those permissions from the <code>user</code> scope. Now <code>user</code> scope will no longer provide access to SSH keys. Applications that need this access should request one of the new scopes described above.</p>

<h2 id="keys-are-now-immutable">Keys are now immutable</h2>

<p>To simplify the security audit trail for SSH keys, we’re making keys immutable. API consumers can continue to create keys and delete keys as needed, but keys can no longer be changed. To change an existing key, API consumers should delete the existing key and create a new one with the desired attributes. This change applies both to a <a href="/v3/users/keys/">user’s SSH keys</a> and a <a href="/v3/repos/keys/">repository’s deploy keys</a>.</p>

<h2 id="deleting-keys-when-revoking-a-token">Deleting keys when revoking a token</h2>

<p>Also any keys created via an OAuth token from this point forward will be deleted when that token is revoked.</p>

    <p>Many third party services need to set up <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/">hooks</a> in order to act upon events
in your repositories. Today, we’ve introduced three new <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes">scopes</a> that provide
more granular access to your repository hooks without allowing access to your
repository contents:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<code>read:repo_hook</code> grants read and ping access to hooks in public or private repositories.</li>
  <li>
<code>write:repo_hook</code> grants read, write, and ping access to hooks in public or private repositories.</li>

    <p>With the release of our <a href="https://github.com/blog/1778-webhooks-level-up">new webhook UI</a>, we included a new
<a href="/webhooks/#ping-event">ping event</a> that webhooks will receive. When you
create a new webhook, we will send this event as an initial test of the webhook.</p>

<p>The ping is only informational, doesn’t need to be responded to in a specific way,
and nothing bad will happen if you respond with an error. It’s just a quick
“hello world” to let you know you set everything up correctly.</p>

<p>We also added a <a href="/v3/repos/hooks/#ping-a-hook">ping endpoint</a> to the hooks API.
By using ping instead of <a href="/v3/repos/hooks/#test-a-push-hook">test</a>, you can ensure
you won’t be limited by the <code>push</code> event requirement that the test endpoint has.</p>

    <p>Today we’re excited to announce a <a href="/v3/repos/deployments/">Deployments API</a>. We ship a lot of
software at GitHub: web, mobile, and native. For the last few years, we’ve been
driving our deployments from our <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jnewland/chatops">ChatOps tooling</a> and we’ve learned a
lot. The Deployments API is a generalization of the approach that we’ve been
taking, and we’re really excited to see what our users and integrations start
building around it.</p>

<p>Deployments are a new model in the GitHub ecosystem. We don’t have any UI
components currently, and deployments are intended to be used exclusively by
tooling.  If you’re familiar with the Status API, you know that it allows
various tools to report on the status of a commit (e.g., the progress of an
attempt to perform a build at a particular commit). The Status API doesn’t
perform the build; it just reports the results. Much like the Status API, we
won’t be doing actual deployments for you. Instead, the API provides a way for
you to track the status of your deployments. We’re hoping to provide
consistency across the various type of release processes, regardless of the
underlying steps involved with getting your code built or shipped to your
servers.</p>

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<h3 id="automatic-merging">Automatic Merging</h3>

<p>The system can auto-merge the default branch for the repository if the
requested deployment ref is behind the default branch. On active projects it’s
easy to fall behind, so let automation watch your back.</p>

<h3 id="commit-status-integration">Commit Status Integration</h3>

<p>By default, the system rejects deployment requests for repositories that have
commit statuses but don’t have a green build for the deployment ref. This can
be bypassed, but is useful in cases where continuous integration is being used.</p>

<h3 id="force-deployments">Force Deployments</h3>

<p>Sometimes the world crashes down on you, and you need to just get the code out
the door.  Forced deployments bypass any commit status checks or ahead/behind
checks in the repository.</p>

<h3 id="deployment-statuses">Deployment Statuses</h3>

<p>Different deployment systems can update the status of a deployment to be
<code>pending</code>, <code>success</code>, <code>failure</code>, or <code>error</code>. There’s also a field for linking
to deployment output.</p>

<h3 id="events">Events</h3>

<p>Both Deployments and Deployment Statuses trigger events on GitHub. 3rd party
integrations can listen for these events via <a href="/v3/repos/hooks/">webhooks</a> and choose
whether or not to actually deploy the repository that the event was created for.</p>

<h2 id="preview-period">Preview Period</h2>

<p>We’re making this new API available today for developers to
<a href="/v3/repos/deployments/#preview-mode" data-proofer-ignore="">preview</a>.  We think developers and existing integrations are
going to love it, but we want to <a href="https://github.com/contact?form%5Bsubject%5D=Deployments+API">get your feedback</a> before we declare
the Deployments API “final” and “unchangeable.” We expect the preview period to
last for roughly 60-90 days.</p>

<p>As we discover opportunities to improve the API during the preview period, we
may ship changes that break clients using the preview version of the API. We
want to iterate quickly. To do so, we will announce any changes here (on the
developer blog), but we will not provide any advance notice.</p>

<p>At the end of preview period, the Deployments API will become an official
component of GitHub API v3. At that point, the new Deployments API will be
stable and suitable for production use.</p>

<p>We hope you’ll take it for a spin and <a href="https://github.com/contact?form%5Bsubject%5D=Deployments+API">send us your feedback</a>.</p>

    <p>On April 15, 2014<a href="#cutover-test">*</a>, the GitHub API will start serving the v3 media type by default. The information below will help you determine whether your applications will be affected by this change. For affected applications, you’ll find tips below to help you smoothly navigate this change.</p>

<h2 id="whats-changing">What’s changing?</h2>

<h3 id="a-new-default-version">A new default version</h3>

<p>There are <a href="/v3/versions">two versions</a> of the GitHub API: <strong>beta</strong> and <strong>v3</strong>. Today, requests receive the beta version by default. On April 15<a href="#cutover-test">*</a>, requests will begin receiving the v3 version by default.</p>

<p>For the most part, beta and v3 are remarkably similar. There are <a href="/v3/versions/#differences-from-beta-version">just a few differences</a> to keep in mind.</p>

<h3 id="a-new-default-media-type">A new default media type</h3>

<p>The version is one part of the <a href="/v3/media">media type</a>. By default, the API provides the beta media type:</p>

<pre><code>application/vnd.github.beta+json
</code></pre>

<p>On April 15<a href="#cutover-test">*</a>, requests will begin responding with the v3 media type by default:</p>

<pre><code>application/vnd.github.v3+json
</code></pre>

<h2 id="who-is-affected">Who is affected?</h2>

<p>Since 2012, we have encouraged developers to explicitly <a href="/v3/media/#request-specific-version">request a specific media type via the <code>Accept</code> header</a>. If you are requesting either beta or v3 via the <code>Accept</code> header, then you are <em>not</em> affected by this change. The API will continue to respond with the requested media type.</p>

<p>If you are not requesting beta or v3 via the <code>Accept</code> header, then the API is currently responding with the beta media type. On April 15<a href="#cutover-test">*</a>, the API will begin responding with the v3 media type. If your application relies on <a href="/v3/versions/#differences-from-beta-version">functionality that differs between beta and v3</a>, then you are affected by this change. You will need to take steps to prepare for the change.</p>

<h2 id="what-should-you-do">What should you do?</h2>

<p>If you are affected by this change, we recommend that you:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Update your applications to depend on the v3 functionality instead of the beta functionality. (If you use one of the popular <a href="/libraries/">client libraries</a>, there’s a good chance that they’ve already done the work for you. In that case, you can just update to the latest version of that library.)</li>
  <li>Request the v3 media type via the <code>Accept</code> header.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you cannot update your application to depend on the v3 functionality by April 15<a href="#cutover-test">*</a>, you can just request the beta media type via the <code>Accept</code> header. Doing so will insulate you from this change.</p>

<h2 id="cutover-test">Cutover test on March 12, 2014</h2>

<p>To help you understand the impact of this change before it becomes permanent, we will temporarily implement this change for a single day on March 12. From approximately 12:01am UTC to 11:59pm UTC on March 12, the API will respond with the v3 media type by default.</p>

<p>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/GitHubAPI">@GitHubAPI</a> to receive updates before and after the test.</p>

<h2 id="stay-informed">Stay informed</h2>

<p>Depending on the results of the cutover test, we may schedule additional tests before the final cutover on April 15. If so, we’ll to announce them in advance. Be sure to stay tuned to the <a href="/changes">blog</a> or follow <a href="https://twitter.com/GitHubAPI">@GitHubAPI</a> for updates.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please <a href="https://github.com/contact?form%5Bsubject%5D=Upcoming+change+to+default+API+media+type">get in touch</a>. We’ll be happy to help.</p>

    <p>Hot on the heels of the <a href="http://developer.github.com/changes/2013-10-29-search-api-becomes-an-official-part-of-github-api-v3/">Search API</a>, the <a href="/v3/repos/releases/">Releases API</a>
is now officially part of GitHub API v3.  We now consider it stable for
production use.  </p>

<h3 id="preview-media-type-no-longer-needed">Preview Media Type No Longer Needed</h3>

<p>If you used the Releases API during the preview period, you needed to provide a custom media type in the <code>Accept</code> header:</p>

<pre><code>application/vnd.github.manifold-preview+json
</code></pre>

<p>Now that the preview period has ended, you no longer need to pass this custom media type.</p>

<p>Instead, we <a href="/v3/media">recommend</a> that you specify <code>v3</code> as the version in the <code>Accept</code> header:</p>

<pre><code>application/vnd.github.v3+json
</code></pre>

<h3 id="onward">Onward!</h3>

<p>Thanks again to everyone that tried out the Releases API during the preview period.
We got some great feedback, and we are already discussing additions to the API.</p>

<p>We can’t wait to see what you ship!</p>

    <p>As we <a href="/changes/2013-09-28-an-update-on-the-new-search-api/">prepare to end the preview period</a> for the new search API,
we’re making sure that it’s ready to handle the traffic from all the apps you’ll build on top of it.</p>

<h2 id="new-validation-rule">New Validation Rule</h2>

<p>In order to support the expected volume of requests, we’re applying a new validation rule to the <a href="/v3/search/#search-code">Code Search API</a>.
Starting today, you will need to scope your code queries to a specific set of users, organizations, or repositories.</p>

<p>As usual, you specify the query via the <code>q</code> parameter.
The value must include <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code#users-organizations-and-repositories">at least one user, organization, or repository</a>.</p>

<p>For example, with this query, we’re searching for code from <a href="https://github.com/twitter">@twitter</a> or <a href="https://github.com/facebook">@facebook</a> that uses an MIT License:</p>

<pre><code>MIT License user:twitter user:facebook
</code></pre>

<p>And here, we’re looking for uses of the underscore library in <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/BrowserQuest">@mozilla’s BrowserQuest</a> repository:</p>

<pre><code>underscore language:js repo:mozilla/BrowserQuest
</code></pre>

<p>To perform these queries via the API, we would use the following URLs (respectively):</p>

<pre><code>https://api.github.com/search/code?q=MIT+License+user%3Atwitter+user%3Afacebook

https://api.github.com/search/code?q=underscore+language%3Ajs+repo%3Amozilla%2FBrowserQuest
</code></pre>

<p>All the various <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code">code search qualifiers</a> are still available to you.
A <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code#users-organizations-and-repositories">user, organization, or repository qualifier</a> is now required.
The other search qualifiers are still optional.</p>

<h2 id="other-search-types-not-affected">Other Search Types Not Affected</h2>

<p>This new validation only applies to the <a href="/v3/search/#search-code">Code Search API</a>.
It does not apply to the Search API for <a href="/v3/search/#search-issues">issues</a>, <a href="/v3/search/#search-users">users</a>, or <a href="/v3/search/#search-repositories">repositories</a>.</p>

<p>This validation does not affect searches performed on <a href="https://github.com/search">github.com/search</a>.</p>

<p>By ensuring that code queries are more targeted in nature, the API will be ready to meet the expected demand from all your apps.
As we continue to tune the Search API, we hope to relax this validation in the future.
There’s no ETA, but we’d like to relax it as soon as it’s feasible.</p>

<p>As always, if you have any questions or feedback, please <a href="https://github.com/contact?form%5Bsubject%5D=New+Validation+Rule+for+Code+Search+API">get in touch</a>.</p>

    <p>Starting today, we are returning granted scopes as part of the
<a href="/v3/oauth/#github-redirects-back-to-your-site">access_token response</a>.
For example, if you are making a POST with the <code>application/json</code>
mime-type you’ll see an additional field for the granted scopes.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript highlight highlight"><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="s2">"access_token"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">"e72e16c7e42f292c6912e7710c838347ae178b4a"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">"scope"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">"repo,gist"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">"token_type"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">"bearer"</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre>

<p>Right now, these scopes will be identical to what you requested, but we
are moving towards a feature set that will allow GitHub users to edit
their scopes, effectively granting your application less access than you
originally requested. You should be aware of this possibility and adjust
your application behavior accordingly.</p>

<p>Some things to watch out for and keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Most third party applications using GitHub OAuth to identify users have
the best success in adoption by starting out with a request for the
minimum access that the application can possibly get away with.
Something like no scopes or just <code>user:email</code> is very sane.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to handle the error cases where a user chooses to
grant you less access than you originally requested. Now that we are
surfacing the granted scopes on the access_token response, applications
can warn or otherwise communicate with their users that they will see
reduced functionality or be unable to perform some actions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Applications can always send users back through the flow again to get
additional permission, but don’t forget that users can always say no.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

    <p>We owe a big “Thank You!” to everyone that has taken the time to try out the <a href="/changes/2013-07-19-preview-the-new-search-api">new Search API</a>.
We <code>:heart:</code> every one of you.
Just as we hoped,
the <a href="/changes/2013-07-19-preview-the-new-search-api/#preview-period">preview period</a> has allowed us to see how you want to use the new API,
and it has given us a chance to improve the API before finalizing it.</p>

<p>In order to incorporate everything that we’ve learned,
we’re going to keep the Search API in <a href="/changes/2013-07-19-preview-the-new-search-api/#preview-period">preview mode</a> for a little while longer.
We have a few bugs to squash and a couple performance kinks to iron out.
We’re hard at work on those improvements now,
and we expect to have more news in the coming weeks.</p>

    <p>This summer we made it easier to <a href="https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software">release your software</a>.  Today, you can fully automate those releases via the
<a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/">Releases API Preview</a>.</p>

<p>This API is a little different due to the binary assets.  We use the <code>Accept</code> header for content negotiation when requesting
a release asset.  Pass a standard API media type to get the API representation:</p>

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -i -H "Authorization: token TOKEN" \
     -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.manifold-preview" \
     "https://uploads.github.com/repos/hubot/singularity/releases/assets/123"

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
  "id": 123,
  ...
}
</pre>

<p>Pass “application/octet-stream” to download the binary content.</p>

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -i -H "Authorization: token TOKEN" \
     -H "Accept: application/octet-stream" \
     "https://uploads.github.com/repos/hubot/singularity/releases/assets/123"

HTTP/1.1 302 Found
</pre>

<p>Uploads are handled by a single request to a companion “uploads.github.com” service.</p>

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -H "Authorization: token TOKEN" \
     -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.manifold-preview" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/zip" \
     --data-binary @build/mac/package.zip \
     "https://uploads.github.com/repos/hubot/singularity/releases/123/assets?name=1.0.0-mac.zip"
</pre>

<h2 id="preview-mode">Preview mode</h2>

<p>The new API is available as a <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#preview-mode">preview</a>.  This gives developers a chance to <a href="https://github.com/contact?form%5Bsubject%5D=New+Releases+API">provide feedback</a> on the direction of
the API before we freeze changes.  We expect to lift the preview status in 30 days.</p>

<p>As with <a href="http://developer.github.com/changes/2013-07-19-preview-the-new-search-api/">the Search API</a>, we’ll take this opportunity to iterate quickly.  Breaking changes will be announced
on this developer blog without any advance warning.  Once the preview period is over, we’ll consider the Releases API unchangeable.
At that point, it will be stable and suitable for production use.</p>

<p>The preview media type is “application/vnd.github.manifold-preview”.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Fesi">Manifold</a> is
a member of the Avengers, with the ability to teleport through time and space.  He’s the one in the middle holding the spear.</p>

    <p>As <a href="https://github.com/blog/1614-two-factor-authentication">announced earlier today</a>, GitHub.com now supports two-factor
authentication (2FA) for increased security. For users with this feature
enabled, GitHub.com will prompt for a 2FA code in addition to a username and
password during authentication. We’ve also rolled out some improvements to the
API to ensure that 2FA requirements in the API are consistent with GitHub.com.</p>

<h2 id="authenticating-with-the-api">Authenticating with the API</h2>

<p>For users without 2FA enabled, and for applications using the <a href="/v3/oauth/#web-application-flow">OAuth web
flow</a> for authentication, everything is
business as usual. You’ll continue to authenticate with the API just as you
always have. (That was easy.)</p>

<p>If you enable 2FA <em>and</em> use Basic Authentication to access the API, we’re
providing multiple options to make the flow simple and easy.</p>

<h2 id="basic-authentication-and-2fa">Basic Authentication and 2FA</h2>

<h3 id="personal-access-tokens">Personal Access Tokens</h3>

<p>Personal access tokens provide the simplest option for using 2FA with Basic
Authentication. You can create these tokens via the <a href="https://github.com/settings/applications">application settings page
on GitHub.com</a>, and you can revoke
them at any time. For more information about authenticating to the API with
personal access tokens, be sure to check out our <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use">help article on the
topic</a>.</p>

<h3 id="tightly-integrated-2fa">Tightly-integrated 2FA</h3>

<p>For developers wishing to integrate GitHub 2FA directly into their application,
the API’s Basic Authentication now supports the <a href="/v3/auth/#working-with-two-factor-authentication">ability to send the user’s 2FA
code</a>, in addition to the username and password.</p>

<h2 id="were-here-to-help">We’re here to help</h2>

<p>We think GitHub users are going to love the additional security provided by
two-factor authentication. As always, if you have any questions or feedback,

    <p>Today we’re shipping two improvements to the <a href="/changes/2013-07-19-preview-the-new-search-api/">new Search API</a>.</p>

<h2 id="more-text-match-metadata">More Text Match Metadata</h2>

<p>When searching for code, the API previously provided <a href="/v3/search/#text-match-metadata">text match metadata</a> (i.e., “highlights”) for file content.
Now, you can also <a href="/v3/search/#highlighting-code-search-results">get this metadata</a> for matches that occur within the file path.</p>

<p>For example, when <a href="https://github.com/search?q=%40octokit%2Foctokit.rb+in%3Apath+client&amp;type=Code">searching for files that have “client” in their path</a>, the results include this match for <code>lib/octokit/client/commits.rb</code>:</p>

<pre class="json">
{
  "name": "commits.rb",
  "path": "lib/octokit/client/commits.rb",
  "text_matches": [
    {
      "object_url": "https://api.github.com/repositories/417862/contents/lib/octokit/client/commits.rb?ref=8d487ab06ccef463aa9f5412a56f1a2f1fa4dc88",
      "object_type": "FileContent",
      "property": "path",
      "fragment": "lib/octokit/client/commits.rb",
      "matches": [
        {
          "text": "client",
          "indices": [ 12, 18 ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  // ...
}
</pre>

<h2 id="better-text-match-metadata">Better Text Match Metadata</h2>

<p>Before today, the API applied HTML entity encoding to all <code>fragment</code> data.
For example, imagine your search returns an issue like <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/11889">rails/rails#11889</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2988/994632/a84f2888-09af-11e3-9417-4bd92f1f1ed6.png" alt="Example Issue Title"></p>

<p>The response would include a <code>text_matches</code> array with the following object:</p>

<pre class="json">
{
  "fragment": "undefined method `except' for #&amp;lt;Array:XXX&amp;gt;",
  // ...
}
</pre>

<p>Inside the <code>fragment</code> value, we see HTML-encoded entities (e.g., <code>&amp;lt;</code>).
Since we’re returning JSON (not HTML), API clients might not expect any HTML-encoded text.
As of today, the API returns these fragments <em>without</em> this extraneous encoding.</p>

<pre class="json">
{
  "fragment": "undefined method `except' for #&lt;Array:XXX&gt;",
  // ...
}
</pre>

<h2 id="preview-period">Preview Period</h2>

<p>We’re about halfway through the <a href="/changes/2013-07-19-preview-the-new-search-api/#preview-period">preview period</a> for the new Search API.

    <p>Today we’re excited to announce a <a href="/v3/search/">brand new Search API</a>. Whether you’re
searching for <a href="/v3/search/#search-code">code</a>, <a href="/v3/search/#search-repositories">repositories</a>,
<a href="/v3/search/#search-issues">issues</a>, or <a href="/v3/search/#search-users">users</a>, all the query abilities of
github.com are now available via the API as well.</p>

<p>Maybe you want to find <a href="/v3/search/#repository-search-example">popular Tetris implementations written in Assembly</a>.
We’ve got you covered.
Or perhaps you’re looking for <a href="/v3/search/#code-search-example">new gems that are using Octokit.rb</a>.
No problem.
The possibilities are endless.</p>

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<p>On github.com, we enjoy the context provided by code snippets and highlights in
search results.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/search?q=faraday+builder+repo%3Aoctokit%2Foctokit.rb&amp;type=Code"><img src="https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/865/819651/959a4826-efb5-11e2-8af8-46c4a3857cdf.png" alt="code-snippet-highlighting"></a></p>

<p>We want API consumers to have access to that information as well. So, API
requests can opt to receive those
<a href="/v3/search#text-match-metadata">text fragments in the response</a>. Each fragment is accompanied by
numeric offsets identifying the exact location of each matching search term.</p>

<h2 id="preview-period">Preview period</h2>

<p>We’re making this new API available today for developers to
<a href="/v3/search/#preview-mode" data-proofer-ignore="">preview</a>. We think developers are going to love it, but we want
to get your feedback before we declare the Search API “final” and
“unchangeable.” We expect the preview period to last for roughly 60 days.</p>

<p>As we discover opportunities to improve this new API during the preview period,
we may ship changes that break clients using the preview version of the API. We
want to iterate quickly. To do so, we will announce any changes here (on the
developer blog), but we will not provide any advance notice.</p>

<p>At the end of preview period, the Search API will become an official component
of GitHub API v3. At that point, the new Search API will be stable and suitable
for production use.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-the-old-search-api">What about the old search API?</h2>

<p>The <a href="/v3/search/legacy/">legacy search API</a> is still available. Many existing clients
depend on it, and it is not changing in any way. While the new API offers much
more functionality, the legacy search endpoints remain an official part of
GitHub API v3.</p>

<h2 id="take-it-for-a-spin">Take it for a spin</h2>

<p>We hope you’ll kick the tires and <a href="https://github.com/contact?form%5Bsubject%5D=New+Search+API">send us your feedback</a>. Happy
<del>searching</del> finding!</p>

    <p>Have you ever wondered when your <a href="/v3/#rate-limiting">rate limit</a> will reset back to its maximum value?
That information is now available in the new <code>X-RateLimit-Reset</code> response header.</p>

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -I https://api.github.com/orgs/octokit

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Status: 200 OK
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 42
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1372700873
...
</pre>

<p>The <code>X-RateLimit-Reset</code> header provides a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix UTC timestamp</a>, letting you know the exact time that your fresh new rate limit kicks in.</p>

<p>The reset timestamp is also available as part of the <code>/rate_limit</code> resource.</p>

know about that Pull Request. In addition to the useful information provided in
the API response, the JSON also includes the <code>merge_commit_sha</code> attribute. This
attribute is a frequent source of misunderstanding, and we aim to remove the
confusion.</p>

<p>To help current API consumers, we’ve <a href="/v3/pulls/#mergability">documented the

<p>To protect future API consumers from this confusion, we have

    <p>We are experimenting with changes to the “Hookshot” backend that powers service
hooks.  There were some significant networking changes with the new cluster,
so there are some new IP whitelist rules for hooks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>204.232.175.64/27</li>
  <li>192.30.252.0/22</li>
</ul>

<p>These are in CIDR notation.  They represent a significant range of GitHub
addresses, meaning this should be the last IP change for a while.  Once this
cluster is activated and we shut the other cluster down, we will be removing
the other entries.</p>

<p>We are currently testing the new backend with all repositories in the GitHub
organization only, and expect to start testing it with user data next week.</p>

<p>This also means we should be able to start accepting <a href="https://github.com/github/github-services/pulls">GitHub Services pull

    <p>We had an issue with the Hookshot load balancer this morning, causing the
majority of hooks to flow to a single node only.  This lead to massive queue
times.  While fixing this, we’re putting the old Services backend in use.</p>

<p>This means the old IPs are back in use.  Use this <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/what-ip-addresses-does-github-use-that-i-should-whitelist">Help guide</a>

    <p>We turned Hookshot (our new GitHub Services backend) on yesterday.  Things have
been pretty smooth, with one issue:  Hooks going to other EC2 nodes come from
the private IP addresses of our nodes in the 10.<em>.</em>.* range.</p>

<p>If your web hook servers are on EC2 and are missing hooks from GitHub due to
an IP restriction, we recommend the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Remove the IP white list.</li>
  <li>Fall back to HTTPS and Basic Auth to restrict pushes to authorized senders only.</li>
</ol>

<p>We’re currently working on solving this problem.  Hit up <a href="mailto:support@github.com">support@github.com</a>

    <p>We are finishing up a new GitHub Services backend, dubbed “Hookshot”, to
increase the speed and reliability of our delivered payloads.  We are doing
what we can to make this a seamless transition for everyone.  However, there
are a few notable changes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There is a new <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/meta/">Meta API endpoint</a>
listing the current public IPs that hooks originate from.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We’re removing the AMQP service from GitHub. It hasn’t worked in quite some
time, and the code it uses doesn’t work in our background workers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We’re also instituting a new guideline to improve the reliability and
maintainability of services in the future. As of today, all new services must
accept an unmodified payload over HTTP. Any service that does not will be
rejected. To see an example of an acceptable service, check out <a href="https://github.com/github/github-services/blob/master/lib/services/codeclimate.rb">Code Climate</a>.
Notice their service simply accepts HTTP POST from GitHub unmodified. For an
example of a service that won’t be accepted after today, check out <a href="https://github.com/github/github-services/blob/master/lib/services/campfire.rb">Campfire</a>. It
uses other Ruby gems and contains custom logic to transform the GitHub payload
to Campfire messages.  Existing hooks will keep working (don’t worry 37signals, we
:heart: Campfire).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We’re making these changes because we want to focus on the reliability of the
core Services backend for everyone.  Maintaining custom logic and libraries for
over 100 services is taking too much of this focus away.</p>

    <p>Following on from our <a href="http://developer.github.com/changes/2012-10-14-rate-limit-changes/">previous post</a>
about requiring requests to include a valid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent">User Agent header</a>
we will soon be changing our API servers to return HTTP 403 
to any clients not providing a valid User Agent header.</p>

<p>We will be making this change on Monday, March 4th 2013.</p>

<p>Setting this helps us identify requests from you, and get in touch with people who are using
the API in a way which causes disruption to GitHub. Most HTTP libraries and tools like cURL
already provide a valid header for you, and allow you to customize it, so this will not require
many of our users to make any changes whatsoever.</p>

    <p>We’ve added a <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes">few new user scopes</a> for 3rd party applications that want very
specific user functionality.  The <code>user:email</code> scope gives apps read-only access
to a user’s private email addresses.  The <code>user:follow</code> scope lets a user
follow and unfollow other users.</p>

<p>This should help keep applications from requiring the <code>user</code> scope, which
can be potentially dangerous.</p>

<p>We also added a read-only endpoint to get a user’s public SSH keys.</p>

    <p>The <a href="/v3/oauth_authorizations/#oauth-authorizations-api">Authorizations API</a> is an easy way to create an OAuth
authorization using Basic Auth. Just POST your desired scopes and optional
note and you get a token back:</p>

<pre class="terminal">
    curl -u pengwynn -d '{"scopes": ["user", "gist"]}' \
         https://api.github.com/authorizations
</pre>

<p>This call creates a token for the authenticating user tied to a special “API”
OAuth application.</p>

<p>We now support creating tokens for <em>your own OAuth application</em> by passing your
twenty character <code>client_id</code> and forty character <code>client_secret</code> as found in
the settings page for your OAuth application.</p>

<pre class="terminal">
    curl -u pengwynn -d '{ \

repository is <code>gitignore_template</code>. This value is the name of one of the
templates from the the public <a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore">GitHub .gitignore repository</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="/v3/gitignore/">Gitignore Templates API</a> makes it easy to list those templates:</p>

    <p>We made a slight change to the way you fork a repository.  By default, you
can fork my repository through an HTTP POST to the repository’s fork resource.</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -X POST https://api.github.com/repos/technoweenie/faraday/forks
</code></pre>

<p>This repository forks to your personal account.  However, there are cases when
you want to fork to one of your organizations instead.  The previous method
required a <code>?org</code> query parameter:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -X POST /repos/technoweenie/faraday/forks?org=mycompany
</code></pre>

<p>Query parameters on POST requests are unusual in APIs, and definitely
inconsistent with the rest of the GitHub API.  You should be able to post a
JSON body like every other POST endpoint.  Now, you can!  Only, now we’re
calling the field <code>organization</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$ curl /repos/technoweenie/faraday/forks?org=mycompany \
  -d '{"organization": "mycompany"}'
</code></pre>

<p>Don’t worry, we are committed to maintaining the legacy behavior until the next
major change of the GitHub API.</p>

    <p>The URIs of all gist comments are changing immediately. The new URI pattern for gist comments is <code>/gists/{gist-id}/comments/{id}</code>. (See <a href="/v3/gists/comments/">gist comments section of the docs</a> for more details.) This change is necessary because the auto-incremented ids of gist comments are easy to guess. This predictability allows anyone to view comments on private Gists with relative ease. Obviously, comments on private gists should be just as private as the gist itself.</p>

<p>Adding the gist id to the URI of comments makes it impossible, in practical terms, to guess that URI because the id of private gists are very large random numbers. This is, unfortunately, a breaking change but one that cannot be avoided because of the security implications of the current URIs. We apologize for the inconvenience.</p>

<p>We have also added a <code>comments_url</code> member to the Gist documents. The <code>comments_url</code> link provides access to the comments of a Gist in a way that will insulate clients from changes in the URI patterns used by the GitHub API. We are increasing our use of links in order to make changes such as this one less damaging to clients. We strongly encourage using <code>url</code> and <code>*_url</code> properties, where possible, rather than constructing URIs using the patterns published on this site. Doing so will result in clients that break less often.</p>

we’ve unleashed all that :sparkles: in a <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/activity/notifications/">brand new API</a>.  You can now
view and mark notifications as read.</p>

<h2 id="endpoint">Endpoint</h2>

<p>The core notifications functionality is under the <code>/notifications</code> endpoint.
You can look for unread notifications:</p>

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl https://api.github.com/notifications

<p>You can filter these notifications to a single Repository:</p>

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/technoweenie/faraday/notifications
</pre>

<p>You can mark them as read:</p>

<pre class="terminal">
# all notifications
$ curl https://api.github.com/notifications \
    -X PUT -d '{"read": true}'

# notifications for a single repository
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/technoweenie/faraday/notifications \
    -X PUT -d '{"read": true}'
</pre>

<p>You can also modify subscriptions for a Repository or a single thread.</p>

<pre class="terminal">
# subscription details for the thread (either an Issue or Commit)
$ curl https://api.github.com/notifications/threads/1/subscription

# subscription details for a whole Repository.
$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/technoweenie/faraday/subscription
</pre>

<h2 id="polling">Polling</h2>

<p>The Notifications API is optimized for polling by the last modified time:</p>

<pre class="terminal">
# Add authentication to your requests
$ curl -I https://api.github.com/notifications

Last-Modified: Thu, 25 Oct 2012 15:16:27 GMT

curl -u pengwynn \
     -d '{"name": "octokit", "default_branch":"development"}' \
     https://api.github.com/repos/pengwynn/octokit

<p>If you provide a branch name that hasn’t been pushed to GitHub, we’ll gracefully fall back to <code>'master'</code> or the first branch.</p>

    <p>Requesting the <a href="/v3/orgs/members/index.html#members-list">member list</a> of an

<a href="/v3/orgs/members/index.html#check-membership">membership check</a> resources of
an organization of which you are not a member are redirected to the equivalent
<a href="/v3/orgs/members/index.html#check-public-membership">public membership check</a>.
One exception to the latter case is that if you are checking about your own
membership the request is not redirected. You are always allowed to know what
organizations you belong to.</p>

<p>The changes where made to clarify the purpose of these various resources. The
<code>/orgs/:org/members</code> resources are intended for use by members of the
organization in question. The <code>/orgs/:org/public_members</code> resources are for
acquiring information about the public membership of organizations. If you are
not a member you are not allowed to see private membership information so you
should be using the public membership resources.</p>

or OAuth. Unauthenticated requests will be limited to 60 per hour unless you
<a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/#increasing-the-unauthenticated-rate-limit-for-oauth-applications">include your OAuth client and
secret</a>.</p>

<p>We’ll soon require all requests to include a valid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent">User Agent
header</a>. Setting a
unique value for this header helps us identify requests and get in touch with
developers who are abusing the API. Most HTTP libraries, wrapper libraries, and
even cURL provide a valid header for you already and allow you to change it to
something unique to your application.</p>

    <p>Today we’ve made it easier to add commits to a repository via the GitHub API.
Until now, you could <a href="/v3/repos/#create">create a repository</a>, but you would
need to initialize it locally via your Git client before adding any commits via
the API.</p>

<p>Now you can optionally init a repository when it’s created by sending <code>true</code>
for the <code>auto_init</code> parameter:</p>

<pre class="terminal">
curl -i -u pengwynn \
     -d '{"name": "create-repo-test", "auto_init": true}' \
     https://api.github.com/user/repos
</pre>

<p>The resulting repository will have a README stub and an initial commit.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/create-repo-init.png" alt="create repo screenshot"></p>

<h3 id="gitignore-templates">.gitignore templates</h3>

<p>Along with this change, you can set up your <code>.gitignore</code> template by passing
the basename of any template in the <a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore">GitHub gitignore templates
project</a>.</p>

<pre class="terminal">
curl -i -u pengwynn \
     -d '{"name": "create-repo-test", "auto_init": true, \
          "gitignore_template": "Haskell"}' \
     https://api.github.com/user/repos
</pre>

<p>As the <a href="/v3/repos/#create">docs point out</a>, the <code>gitignore_template</code> parameter
is ignored if <code>auto_init</code> is not present and <code>true</code>.</p>

  <h2 class="title">
  <a href="/changes/2012-9-5-watcher-api/">Upcoming Changes to Watcher and Star APIs</a>
</h2>

<div class="meta">
  <ul>
  <li class="published">
    <span class="octicon octicon-calendar"></span>
    September 5, 2012
    
  </li>

  </li>
</ul>
</div>

    <p>We recently <a href="https://github.com/blog/1204-notifications-stars">changed the Watcher behavior</a> on GitHub.  What
used to be known as “Watching” is now “Starring”.  Starring is basically a way
to bookmark interesting repositories.  Watching is a way to indicate that you
want to receive email or web notifications on a Repository.</p>

<p>This works well on GitHub.com, but poses a problem for the GitHub API.  How do
we change this in a way that developers can gracefully upgrade their
applications?  We’re currently looking at rolling out the changes in three
phases over an extended period of time.</p>

<h2 id="current-status">Current Status</h2>

<p>The current <a href="/v3/activity/starring/">Repository Starring</a> methods look like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<code>/repos/:owner/:repo/watchers</code> - A list of users starring the repository.</li>
  <li>
<code>/users/:user/watched</code> - A list of repositories that a user has starred.</li>
  <li>
<code>/user/watched</code> - A list of repositories the current user has starred.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="phase-1-add-watchers-as-subscriptions">Phase 1: Add Watchers as Subscriptions</h2>

<p>This phase exposes Watchers as “Subscriptions”.  This is to
keep from clashing with the legacy endpoints.  This phase will happen
automatically <s>and will not break your application until Phase 3 starts</s>.
(<strong>UPDATE</strong>: API v3 will continue to support this functionality indefinitely.)</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<code>/repos/:owner/:repo/subscribers</code> - A list of users watching the repository.</li>
  <li>
<code>/users/:user/subscriptions</code> - A list of repositories that a user is watching.</li>
  <li>
<code>/user/subscriptions</code> - A list of repositories the current user is watching.</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll also add a copy of the legacy Watchers API in the new endpoint:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<code>/repos/:owner/:repo/stargazers</code> - A list of users starring the repository.</li>
  <li>
<code>/users/:user/starred</code> - A list of repositories that a user has starred.</li>
  <li>
<code>/user/starred</code> - A list of repositories the current user has starred.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is in place <em>now</em> with the current media type for the API:</p>

<pre><code>application/vnd.github.beta+json
</code></pre>

<p>If you care about your application not breaking, make sure all outgoing API
requests pass that value for the “Accept” header.  You should do this now.  This
can be verified by checking the <code>X-GitHub-Media-Type</code> header on all API
responses.</p>

<pre><code># Accesses a user's starred repositories.
curl https://api.github.com/user/watched \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.beta+json"
</code></pre>

<p>-<s>This Phase will be broken once Phase 3 starts.  Phase 3 removes all support for
the "beta" media type, and makes the "v3" media type the implicit default
for API requests.</s></p>

<h2 id="update---november-6-2013">UPDATE - November 6, 2013</h2>

<div class="alert">
  <p>
    API v3 will continue to officially support the functionality described in
    Phase 1 above. This functionality will remain intact for the lifetime of
    API v3.
  </p>
  <p>
    API v3 will <em>not</em> include Phases 2 and 3 (below). Those phases will
    likely be part of the next major version of the API. (We have not announced
    a timeline for the next major version of the API.)
  </p>
</div>

<h2 id="sphase-2-switch-codewatcherscode-api-endpoints"><s>Phase 2: Switch <code>/watchers</code> API Endpoint</s></h2>

<s>The "watch" endpoints will now be a copy of the "subscription" endpoints.  You
will have to use <code>/user/starred</code> to get a user's starred repositories, not
<code>/user/watched</code>.</s>

<s>This requires a new media type value:</s>

<s><pre>application/vnd.github.v3+json</pre></s>

<s>This is a breaking change from Phase 1.  We will release this change in an
experimental mode first, letting developers gracefully upgrade their
applications by specifying the new media value for the Accept header.</s>

<s>
<pre>
# Accesses a user's watched repositories.
curl https://api.github.com/user/watched \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json"
</pre>
</s>

<h2 id="sphase-3-remove-codesubscriberscode-api-endpoints"><s>Phase 3: Remove <code>/subscribers</code> API Endpoint.</s></h2>

<s>This phase involves disabling the subscription endpoints completely.  At this
point, you should be using the starring endpoints for starred repositories, and
the watch endpoints for watched repositories.  No date has been set yet, but we
expect this to be <em>3-6 months</em> after Phase 2 is in place.  This should give
developers enough time for a smooth upgrade path.  If they use popular API
wrappers, the work will likely mostly be done for them.</s>

<s>Keep on passing the "v3" media type in your application, until the API has
another breaking change to make.  If you can't make the deadline for Phase 3,
just set the "beta" media type until we shut that down completely.  It's likely
that we will keep the old "beta" media type active for another month, like
the <a href="https://github.com/blog/1090-github-api-moving-on">last time</a> we terminated
old API functionality.</s>
