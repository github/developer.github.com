To ensure a high quality of service for all API consumers, we've reduced the
default rate limit for unauthenticated requests. To enjoy the default rate
limit of 5,000 requests per hour, you'll need to
[authenticate](http://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication) via Basic Auth
or OAuth. Unauthenticated requests will be limited to 60 per hour unless you
[include your OAuth client and
secret](http://developer.github.com/v3/#unauthenticated-rate-limited-requests).

We'll soon require all requests to include a valid [User Agent
header](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent). Setting a
unique value for this header helps us identify requests and get in touch with
developers who are abusing the API. Most HTTP libraries, wrapper libraries, and
even cURL provide a valid header for you already and allow you to change it to
something unique to your application.
