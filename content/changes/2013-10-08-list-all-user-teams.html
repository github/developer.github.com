We just added a [new API method](/v3/orgs/teams/#list-user-teams) to list all
the teams for the authenticated user across all organizations:

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -H "Authorization: token [yours]" https://api.github.com/user/teams

[
  {
    "name": "Testing",
    "id": 396018,
    "slug": "testing",
    "permission": "pull",
    "url": "https://api.github.com/teams/396018",
    "members_url": "https://api.github.com/teams/396018/members{/member}",
    "repositories_url": "https://api.github.com/teams/396018/repos",
    "members_count": 1,
    "repos_count": 0,
    "organization": {
      "login": "dotfiles",
      "id": 1593590,
      "url": "https://api.github.com/orgs/dotfiles",
      "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/orgs/dotfiles/repos",
      "events_url": "https://api.github.com/orgs/dotfiles/events",
      "members_url": "https://api.github.com/orgs/dotfiles/members{/member}",
      "public_members_url": "https://api.github.com/orgs/dotfiles/public_members{/member}",
      "avatar_url": "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/67d30facf213f62853c119fc2a05e246?d=https%3A%2F%2Fidenticons.github.com%2Fc90a68e6ab739e81c642f0e93f88c722.png"
    }
  },
  ...
