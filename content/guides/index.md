# Development Guides

This section of the documentation is intended to get you up-and-running with
real-world GitHub API applications. We'll cover everything you need to know, from
authentication, to manipulating results, to combining results with other services.

Every tutorial here will have a project, and every project will be
stored and documented in our public
[platform-samples](https://github.com/github/platform-samples) repository.

Feel free to fork, clone, and improve these guides.
