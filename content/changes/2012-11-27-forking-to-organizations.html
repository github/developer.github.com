We made a slight change to the way you fork a repository.  By default, you
can fork my repository through an HTTP POST to the repository's fork resource.

    $ curl -X POST https://api.github.com/repos/technoweenie/faraday/forks

This repository forks to your personal account.  However, there are cases when
you want to fork to one of your organizations instead.  The previous method
required a `?org` query parameter:

    $ curl -X POST /repos/technoweenie/faraday/forks?org=mycompany

Query parameters on POST requests are unusual in APIs, and definitely
inconsistent with the rest of the GitHub API.  You should be able to post a
JSON body like every other POST endpoint.  Now, you can!  Only, now we're
calling the field `organization`.

    $ curl /repos/technoweenie/faraday/forks?org=mycompany \
      -d '{"organization": "mycompany"}'

Don't worry, we are committed to maintaining the legacy behavior until the next
major change of the GitHub API.
